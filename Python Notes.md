## Data Types
**Python and Object**
- In Python, objects are abstraction for data.

### Mutable and Inmutable
-  If the value can change, the object is called **mutable**, while if the value cannot change, the object is called **immutable**.

- Custom objects in Python are mutable.

### Numbers
-  Python integers have an unlimited range, subject only to the available virtual memory. This means that it doesn't really matter how big a number you want to store is: as long as it can fit in your computer's memory, Python will take care of it. Integer numbers can be positive, negative, and 0 (zero). 

-  Python has two division operators, one performs the so-called true division (/), which returns the quotient of the operands, and the other one, the so-called integer division (//), which
returns the floored quotient of the operands.
